Introduction
=======================

SillI 2D is a two-dimensional, mixed Finite-Element-Method (FEM) and
Finite-Volume-Method (FVM) tool that evaluates the thermal effects of
magmatic intrusion within sedimentary basins. The application models the
conductive and advective transfer of energy around cooling sills and
incorporates latent heat effects of crystallization or organic matter
maturation. SillI 2D can also synthesize vitrinite reflectance response
to thermal changes in the surrounding aureole and generate methane from
organic carbon-rich source rocks. Methane generated by thermal cracking
of organic matter can be accurately tracked by SillI 2D using FVM and
can also result in overpressure fracturing in the host rock leading to
the formation of vent structures. SillI 2D thus provides a
state-of-the-art tool to investigate and analyze multiple processes
associated with igneous intrusions and provide a better understanding of
atypical petroleum systems.
