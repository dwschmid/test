At the hut
=======================

The day before your arrival we sms you the code for the key box next to the door. There you will find two keys, one for the main house door and one for the outside storage room. 

You may have to increase the temperature in the hut. We usually set the thermostats to 23 degrees where there are tiles on the floor and to 21 degrees where there are wooden floors, with the exception of the bed rooms that we like colder. You set it to what you feel is comfortable! Note that the heating on the ground floor is water-based floor heating and takes a few hours to heat to get to the desired temperatures.
